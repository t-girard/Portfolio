                <p>This site was created on its own as part of a project for BUT.</p>
                <p>The goal was to make a game on a website. </p>
                <p>The site is heavily inspired by the famous video game "Pong" released in 1972. </p>
                <p>This project taught me a lot, including how to use javascript for animations. </p>
                <p>I also discovered different facets of video game creation such as design, gameplay and bug solving. </p>
                <p>I did everything myself including the design of the site. </p>
                <p>You can download the site by clicking on the button below. </p>
